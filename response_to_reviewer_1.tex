        This is the response to reviewer one's first comment.
        Here is a bulleted list of some changes:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item We changed the wording to make things more clear, pages 3--4, lines 181--253.
          \item Addition of a new section titled ``My New Section'', beginning on page 4, line 254.
                This section provides a detailed description of something the reviewer wanted.
        \end{itemize}

        \vspace{2ex}
  \item \textit{This is reviewer one's second comment.}
        \vspace{2ex}

        Don't forget to include a vspace of size 2ex between each comment and response.
        Also, here is how I cite a paper for the reviewer:
