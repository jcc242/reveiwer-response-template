# reveiwer-response-template
A LaTeX template for responding to peer review comments.

Use the included Makefile to compile the document with GNU Make by running ```make``` in this project's directory.

Compiling the LaTeX does not require the CFD lab's macros file or cfdp style files. 
A few commonly used symbols are defined in the header, such as the symbols used for grid metrics, some bold characters, and so forth.
If you wish to use the cfdp style files, be sure to comment or delete these definitions first.
